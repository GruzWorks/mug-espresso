Ah shit, here we go again.

## Build/Run

1. Open project (root of the repo) with Android Studio (tested on 3.5.1, should work on the newer ones as well)
1. Wait for gradle to finish sync
1. Run/Debug configuration should be created automatically, if not create an Android App configuration for module `app`
1. If using physical device, turn on USB debugging and connect it via USB cable
1. Select device to run
1. Run xD
